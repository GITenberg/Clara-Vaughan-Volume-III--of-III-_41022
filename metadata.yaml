description: "Clara Vaughan is a sensation novel by R. D. Blackmore, who was later\
  \ to achieve lasting fame for another Romantic novel, Lorna Doone. It was written\
  \ in 1853 and published anonymously in 1864. It was Blackmore's first novel. The\
  \ novel was generally well received by the public, though some reviewers at the\
  \ time believed it to have been written by Mary Elizabeth Braddon and criticised\
  \ its author for not knowing about the law.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
